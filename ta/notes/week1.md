## Jon meeting
### Bugs
github issue: Docker didn't download `jovyan/Documents/CASA`, so the comand

```bash
cd ~/Documents/CASA/fsds/
quarto render articles/Template.qmd

```
doesn't work from Week1.

### TA
Ask:

1. to start the partical by installing `docker` and `WSL`, the rest can be
easily done by the students themselves at home.
2. For WSL2 users: `docker-engine` is ok or do we need docker Desktop?
3. Not very familiar with Mac
4. Do I have to keep an excel sheet for the number of hours?
